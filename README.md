# Fingerprint-Recognition
This project implements a fingerprint recognition system using ORB for feature extraction and SVM for classification in Python. It preprocesses fingerprint images, trains a machine learning model, and predicts the person ID from new inputs. The system is designed for beginners to learn biometric authentication and image processing.
