Fingerprint Recognition using ORB and SVM

This project implements a fingerprint recognition system using ORB feature extraction and SVM classification in Python.

Features
- Fingerprint preprocessing
- ORB feature extraction
- SVM classification
- Prediction and visualization
- Model saving

Requirements
Install dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Run
1. Update dataset path in code
2. Run the script in VS Code or Jupyter
3. Use predict_image() for testing

Output
Displays predicted fingerprint ID with image.
